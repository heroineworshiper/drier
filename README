Solar filament drier

This measures dew point on the inside & outside of a container.  When
the outside dewpoint is lower than the inside dewpoint, it turns on a
pump to replace the air.

It's based on a PIC 18F1320 with MOSFETS to control a circulation fan &
pump. 

Temperature & humidity are measured by 2 AHT20's.  Everything runs on
5V.  A fan circulates air in the container.  The pump has a software
fuse to detect stalls.  The tube is 1/4" tube.

It could in theory run in less memory if it uses fixed point.  Floating
point has better accuracy.
