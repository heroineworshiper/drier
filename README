Solar filament drier

This measures dew point on the inside & outside of a container.  When
the outside dewpoint is lower than the inside dewpoint, it opens a valve
to replace the air.

It's based on a PIC 18F1320 with a MOSFET to control a fan & PWM for a
servo controlled butterfly valve. 

Temperature & humidity are measured by 2 AHT20's.  Everything runs on
5V.  A fan circulates air in the container.
