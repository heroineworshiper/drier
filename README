Solar filament drier

This measures dew point on the inside & outside of a container, pumping
in air when the outside dewpoint is lower than the inside dewpoint.

It's based on a PIC 18F1220 with some MOSFETs to control a fan & pump. 

Temperature & humidity are measured by 2 AHT20's.  Everything runs on
5V.  A 1R resistor drops the voltage feeding the pump.  Voltage measured
at the low point of the resistor detects a stall.

The fan circulates air in the container & the pump pumps outside air
in.  It's usually more convenient to suck inside air out so the lid
doesn't pop off.

The tubing has valves so the container can be sealed off for storage.
