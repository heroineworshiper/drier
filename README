Solar filament drier

This measures dew point on the inside & outside of a container, pumping
in air when the outside dewpoint is lower than the inside dewpoint.

It's based on a PIC 18F1220 with some MOSFETs to control a fan & pump. 
The fan circulates air in the container & the pump pumps outside air
in.  It's usually more convenient to suck inside air out so the lid
doesn't pop off.
